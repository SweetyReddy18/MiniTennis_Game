# MiniTennis_Game
This is a game developed using java (AWT).
The game starts with the ball falling from the top of the screen.
There will be a bat (horizontally) which can catch the ball
If ball is caught, you score a point.
Otherwise, the size of the bat reduces.
As the score increases, the speed of the ball increases.
And the Background Colour Changes after each level
